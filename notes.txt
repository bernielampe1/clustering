implement dbscan, fuzzy cmeans, em, mean shift, spectral clustering, normalized cuts
implement kernel algorithms

add sparse matrix type for clustering and base matrix type which both inherit from
add random function to matrix and create a cs demo using sparse matrix

write report for each algorithm, regular, kernel and cs compare to https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8014707
